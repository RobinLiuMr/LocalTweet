+ Idea: let local citizens or travellers know efficiently about the most important information on Twitter, for example information from local government, police, and public traffic provider in a city
- Philosophy: do not overuse the humanity weakness; focus the information users needed instead of adding too much eye-catching things
- Userstory
	- users can see information form default city
	- mobile device users see only three twitters from local government; Tag buttons to change three channels of government, police and traffic
	- large-screen device users see each latest three twitters separately form local government, police, and public traffic provider of default city on large screens
	- users can click one more button to show double the no. of twitters in current scenarios, but it supports only one-time
	- users can search a city (google-similar), after entering, they can see the responding information of input city
	- users can click any information card to go to the original twitter for more details, pictures, or links.
